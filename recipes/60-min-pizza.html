    <p>The first recipie I followed from one of my favorite Youtubers, Brian Lagerstrom. This pizza comes together in 
        about 60 minutes start to finish with a little bit of practice and significantly simplifies the process of
        pizza making! Instructional video can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T57vFsL8eAU">here</a></p>
